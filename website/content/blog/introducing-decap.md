We are proud to introduce Decap CMS, the rebranded and revitalized version of Netlify CMS. We took this step because we didn't like that this awesome project was slowly dying, and we wanted to ensure that it would continue to be supported and improved.

We love Netlify CMS for multiple reasons. Its ease of configuration and how simple it is for editors to use. Additionally it ships with lots of features and is highly customisable. It is also an integral part of the great Jamstack and open source community.

As the new maintainers of Decap CMS, our plan is to continue on the promise of a simple, easy-to-use, open source, git-based CMS. We are excited about the potential for this type of product and are committed to ensuring that it remains a viable option for developers and editors alike.

First we plan to solve deprecation issues. We will also be working on improving the documentation and answer community question on our channels. Additionally, we will continue to engage with the community to gather feedback and make improvements based on the needs of the users. We will gladly accept any contributions in form of pull requests, issues and discussions on GitHub.

We understand that there may be some growing pains as we transition to being the maintainers of the project, but we are committed to making the process as smooth as possible. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions or concerns. We are excited to continue developing and improving Decap CMS with your help!
