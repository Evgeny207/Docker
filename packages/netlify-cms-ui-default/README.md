# Netlify CMS UI Default

This package contains the default UI elements that are used in Netlify CMS.

*This specific package contains breaking changes from Netlify 2.x.*

Part of the 3.0 update is a UI overhaul. This means that the `netlify-cms-ui-legacy` package contains the 2.0 styling.
This `netlify-cms-ui-default` package is entirely new, and contains the styles, and components for the new UI.
